# Udemy Terraform Learning

This repository is the Udemy Terraform coursework that I've done to learn the beginnings of Terraform.

11/15 - I'm attempting to migrate this project into TFE
11/15 - Modification 1

11/16 - this infrastructure has now been initialized and created using TFE. Yes, I understand it's best practice to _hide_ this stuff in a private repo, but as I learn I want this visible so others can critique my learning.
